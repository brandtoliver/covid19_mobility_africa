# **Movements in around in Nigeria**

{{< vspace 20 >}}

Intuitively lockdowns and curfews should have an effect on how people move. In this post the idea is to investigate how people have moved within Lagos and Abuja in Nigeria, as these are the cities where enough data has been collected.

In order to get a better understanding of the actual movements, the particle city movement visualization can be investigated.

By looking at this plot, we get an overview of how people move around during the lockdown. In Lagos, when scrolling through all the dates, it looks like there is a tendency of people moving less in the beginning of the lockdown and then starting to move more around in the end. Movements are still observed in the beginning, but the amount of people moving around is often less than the baseline.

This can also be seen in the staying home visualization for the Nairobi, where a small decline in the number of people staying at home is observed. Even though, the staying home plot is less granulated than those above, the trend can be observed, where people start to move around more.

In addition to this, it is interesting to observe how people tend to leave their homes over the weekends. This makes sense as in large cities a lot of the workers are probably born in the countryside and then have moved to the city to find work, which means they spend some of their weekends going back to their families.
