# **Nigeria**

In Nigeria it has been decided to both put the country in a complete lockdown including curfew during the night. This is despite the relatively low amount of new cases, but as it has been seen it other countries things can go wrong extremely fast. 

Nigeria differs from Kenya as every state has their own responsibility for handling the outbreaks, which means that there is less national control as it is seen in the US. This means that there is no exact date, where the entire country closed down as in Kenya and Denmark, but in this timeline an estimate of the nationwide events is provided.
