The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted nearly every part of a typical Danish life. Among all the major disruptions, perhaps the biggest has been the impact the outbreak has had on working lives. 

At the peak of the Danish lock-down, most public employees (all except for those carrying out tasks of a critical nature) and an estimated one-third of people working in the private sector, were working from home. Read that one more time. One out of every three people working in the Danish private sector were working from home – voluntarily! 

So the nation-wide impact on working habits is huge, but there is much more to be learned. Using the [Going out](/visualizations/where_people_are_going_out/) and [Staying home](/visualizations/where_people_are_going_out/) visualizations, we can 1) explore where the Danes spend their times during working hours; 2) Compare the observations to how Danes were spending this time in February; and 3) Investigate regional differences and changes over time --  are things slowly going back to normal?

There's many interesting things to be said from these visualizations and after reading this post, we encourage you to dive into this yourself. First, however, we go through a few of the observations we have found particularly thought-provoking. 

#### **Observation 1: On a nation-wide scale, behavior seems to slowly converge back to normal**

The [Going out](/visualizations/where_people_are_going_out/) and [Staying home](/visualizations/where_people_are_going_out/) visualizations are related. They both assess where the Danes are located between 10 am and 18 pm. The [Going out](/visualizations/where_people_are_going_out/) visualization shows how many people spend most of this time elsewhere compared to where they spend their evening and night. The [Staying home](/visualizations/where_people_are_going_out/) visualization reveals how many people spend the day in the same place. 

Before the new virus made its appearance in Denmark, there were clear differences between weekdays and weekends: While moving about between Monday and Friday, Danes would stay home over the weekend. While such differences still exist, the discepancy between weekends and weekdays is much smaller during the emergency. Since the end of March, however, the weekly oscillations have consistently gained amplitude. The left-hand panel above illustrates that this is true for the tendency for people to go out, whereas the right-hand panel above shows that the same is true for the number of people staying at home during work hours. These plots probably indicate a slow convergence back to normal. 

#### **Observation 2: There are very clear regional differences in the return to normal**
The above figures illustrated behavior patterns on a national scale. One of the things we find most fascinating about the Danish behavior change, is the captivating regional heterogeneity visible in the data. As you can check for yourself, the oscillatory pattern distinguishing weekends from weekdays is clearly visible in some of the major cities, including Copenhagen. <!--When focusing on large cities located some distance away from the primary Danish populations hubs, it is clear that the beautiful periodic behavior is not present everywhere in Denmark. In the figure below, we show the number of users in **Holbæk** going out during work hours. ![img](/goingout-holbaek.png) -->

Looking away from the major cities, however, data shows something totally unexpected! As illustrated below, **the people of Norddjurs** going out during work hours are currently perfectly out of phase with their baseline behavior (and the rest of the population)!

#### **Observation 3: What's up with the weekends?**
If we pause plotting the absolute numbers of people on the vertical axis and instead focus on relative changes, something spectacular becomes apparent. The figure below shows the relative change of people going out during work hours. During weekdays, the activity is slowly ramping up -- from -50% in March to -30% last week. But notice the weekends -- the activity is accelerating!  This is probably an artifact of the baseline representing activity in February. In the sweet spring sunshine, Danes are attracted to the always-cozy public parks, and nearby forests.

#### **Go explore**
You can explore the [Going out](/visualizations/where_people_are_going_out/) and [Staying home](/visualizations/where_people_are_going_out/) visualizations. For example, see the regional differences for yourself by checking out major cities like Copenhagen and Aarhus and comparing to smaller ones like Holbæk and Guldborgssund.

> THE OVERALL STORY TO BE WRITTEN: We know that most of the workforce is sent home, but there are also companies that have not stopped operations. By looking at changes between population distirbution at night and day, we can assess the amount of people that spend the working hours (10–18) of the day away from home, and are thus (likely) going to work. We can also analyse this using mobility data, but I don't know if we should include this, maybe it just confuses, there are serious bias-causing issues with the 'mobility between tiles' data due to privacy preservation. Look at it and decide if it makes sense.

### **Leaving home during the day**

By looking at how the number of people spending most of their time in a given area changes between working hours (10–18) and non-working hours (18–02) we can assess how many individuals leave their home during the day (for example to go to work). We use the following reasoning: if 80 people spent most of their time in a given tile during working hours and the number is 100 during non-working hours (allowing us to assume that 100 people live there), we can say that 20 people were not at home during the working hours of the day. This is not a perfect measure, as work and home areas are not fully seperated, so the numbers we report are a lower bound, as some people will work very near home, or work where others live. *The important to look for here is how the daily measurements deviate from the baseline.*

Note that you can interact with the figure below. You can:
1. Change the municipality displayed using the **dropdown menu**.
2. Toggle whether the y-axis displays the absolute measurements (rel{{< color color="white" >}}/{{< /color >}}**abs**) or the deviation from the baseline (**rel**{{< color color="white" >}}/{{< /color >}}abs).

**Observation 4:** *People are spending less time away from home during weekdays*. This is an expected pattern (around -50%, toggle **rel** abs to inspect), and corroborates *Observation 3*.

**Observation 5:** *People are more away from home on weekends*, which is a trend that seems to increase over time. One plausible explanation for this is that the weather in Denmark has been exceptionally good during April motivating people to spend more time outside. At the same time, the baseline is based on data from January and February, where people tend to stay inside because of cold weather. Even so, however, the large increase in the most recent weekends *[written: May 4]* shows that people are going out on weekends more.

**Observation 6:** *Date of child-care reopening is a changepoint*. April 15 when daycare institutions, kindergardens and school for the youngest opened back up (at 50% capacity), the number of people leaving their home during working hours seems to rise above the trend seen previously in the lockdown. In the following weeks more people follow suit (though still around -35% reduction).
