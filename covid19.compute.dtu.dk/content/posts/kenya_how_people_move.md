# **Movements in Kenya**

{{< vspace 20 >}}

Intuitively lockdowns and curfews should have an effect on how people move. In this post the idea is to investigate how people have moved within Nairobi and Mombasa in Kenya, as these are the cities where enough data has been collected.

In order to get a better understanding of the actual movements, the particle city movement visualization can be investigated.

By looking at this plot, we get an overview of how people move around during the lockdown. In Nairobi, when scrolling through all the dates, it looks like there is a tendency of people moving less in the beginning of the lockdown and then starting to move more around in the end.
