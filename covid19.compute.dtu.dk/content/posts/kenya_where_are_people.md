# **Kenya**

In this post an investigation of where people are staying in Kenya can be found. 

It is interesting to investigate if people actually stay home during work hours. In the *going out* visualization an overview can be found. It is interesting that it can be seen how people start to move around more and more and in the end of May it is almost back at the normal level despite the fact that the lockdown is still in place.

The next question is then to investigate if this tendency is affecting the population size in the different counties.
