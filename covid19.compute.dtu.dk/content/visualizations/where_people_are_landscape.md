The population density maps describe the number of people in *tiles* (square areas) throughout the country at different time-intervals. 

In the two figures below we plot tiles with a **height** that corresponds to their baseline—pre-lockdown—count (how many people are usually in this tile), and a **color** that corresponds to the percentage change from that baseline (how did the population in that tile change). 

Maximally **{{< color color="#c0392b" >}}red tiles{{< /color >}}** contain less than half of the people they usually contain (≤ –50% deviation from baseline). Maximally **{{< color color="#009432" >}}green tiles{{< /color >}}** contain more than one and a half times their usual count (≥ 50% deviation from baseline).
