The figures below show how the number of occupants changed over time across Danish municipalities. You can play with the figures as follows: 
- Change the (rel{{< color color="white" >}}/{{< /color >}}**abs**) button on the top left of the figure to display absolute values or relative changes with respect to February.
- Display values computed in a specific time of the day by changing the time interval (All day/10-18/18-02) in the top left of the figure.

The first figure shows how the population size evolved across municipalities over time. Each black line corresponds to a different municipality.
You can move the mouse over a line to display the corresponding municipality name.

The second figure lets you select individual municipalities from the drop-down menu. The dotted line displays the daily data, the red line shows the average over a window of 7 days and the dashed line displays the value computed in the corresponding weekday during February.
